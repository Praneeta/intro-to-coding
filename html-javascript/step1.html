    <p>
      This is a sample of how you can use javascript with html.
      It teaches you what are variables and functions and how to use them.
    </p>
    <script type="text/javascript">

      // This is how you create a function.
      // A function is a collection of instructions that when perform a task.
      // The function below prints the length of your name.
      function nameLength() {

        // This collects you name in a variable so that you can use it
        // in multiple places without repeating yourself
        var name = 'Praneeta';

        var nameLength = name.length;

        // You can alert the statements
        // You can create a long string by combining small strings and variables.

        var displayString = 'Hello' + name + '. The length to you name is ' + nameLength

        alert(displayString)

        // This is how you write comments in javascript
        // Any line that starts with // will not be computed.
        // This will print the name length in your console.
        // To open console, right click on the web page and select Inspect Element
        // Click on console tab and you should see this statement there.
        console.log('Hello' + name + '. The length to you name is ' + nameLength)


        // Task 1:
        // Change the displayString to now say:
        // My name is Vrunda. My name has 6 letters
        // Do this by combining variables and strings.

        // Task 2:
        // Change the console log to be same as the displayString.
      }

      // This is how you call a function.
      nameLength();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
