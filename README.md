An introduction to coding for beginners. A quick and fun way to learn to web development.

<strong>Step 1: Create your own github repository.</strong><br /> Public github repositories are free for everyone. <br />a) They are a great way to keep your code in the cloud, so you can access it from anywhere, anytime. <br />b)They are a great way to collaborate with your team mates. <br />c)They are a great way to show off your coding skills and contribute to open source projects. <br /> (If your code is not meant for everyone's eyes and you'd like to keep it private, you can either pay for the github's private repos or look at <a href ="bitbucket.org">bit bucket</a>) <br /> Git has a good tool that for both <a href="https://mac.github.com/">mac</a> and <a href="https://windows.github.com/">windows</a> or you can always use the command line tools. <br /><br />
<strong>Step 2: Download a good editor tool.</strong><br /> There are several editors out there. And every programmer has a favorite one. <br /><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> and <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> are a couple I'd recommend for beginners. I use Sublime Text which has a small license fee. Atom I belive is free. These have various plugins that help you code faster. <br /><br />
<strong>Step 3: Clone this repository.</strong><br /> This respository has some simple examples that will help you create a simple webpage.
